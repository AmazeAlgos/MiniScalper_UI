# MiniScalper_UI
This ui is still under development. Contains 2-3 known bugs .
1. After always on top enabled if transparency slider is opened, it opens under the mainwindow causing it inoperable and it doesn't close on mouse leave event . It makes the ui to not close properly. Disabling always on top again resolves the issue but need a better solution here.
2. Window arrangement goes wrong when selecting different positions.( Afterwards, a mouse drag arranges the windows as it should.)
